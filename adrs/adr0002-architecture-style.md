# ADR0002 - Architecture Style
Creation: 26.Apr.2021

## Status (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded)
_current status_

## Context
The current architecture style of the system is a monolith.  
The following limitations (red stikers) were identified when analysing the documentation/slides and video. The architecture characteristic (quality attribute) which needs to be addressed is shown in yellow.

</p>
Moreover, it has been perceived that costs are not a main limiting driver for the architecture style. 
  
  
The possible Architecture styles are provided below. On the diagram we have the above identified architecture characteristics highlighted for the architectures which maximize the architecture characteristic.  
The **Microservices architecture** is the recommended architecture, as it maximizes the benefits of the most relevant architecture characteristics.
